# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Todo-List project:

This project is personnal, I tried to fully understand React's functionnalities creating a todo list.
I used TailwindCSS, React + Vite, setState and PropTypes.
It was a very interesting work based on a simple functionnality such as receiving datas, showing and deleting it with different buttons.

# How to see the project.

Simply clone the repository, type 'npm install' then 'npm run dev'.
Have a good day !
